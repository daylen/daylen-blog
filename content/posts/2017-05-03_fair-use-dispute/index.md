#### i’m secretly a lawyer

Recently, YouTube blocked one of the videos I uploaded from playing in “247 countries”. That’s like all of them. Thanks YouTube.

they got them in alphabetical order too



So here’s what I sent back.
> I believe that my video’s use of “Die Antwoord-Daddy” constitutes fair use for the following reasons:> 1. Purpose of the use: This video is non-commercial (the event was free, and this video is freely viewable), and it is transformative: it provides new, novel dance choreography created entirely by UC Berkeley students.> 2. The amount of the portion used: This video of a dance performance only uses a small section of the original work — the part that the students created choreography for.> 3. Effect on the market of the copyrighted work: The market of the copyrighted work will not be negatively affected — there is loud clapping from the audience, so nobody would listen to the audio by itself. In fact, it is _more_ likely that viewers will then go out and purchase the song so that they can listen to it by themselves.> In short, this is a recording of a free dance performance featuring student-created choreography, intended only for educational purposes of teaching newer generations of dancers about how to dance to music like “Die Antwoord-Daddy.” Because it is a transformative use of the song, and for all the reasons stated above, I believe this constitutes fair use.

Mic. Drop.
