#### I gave myself a performance review
![image](/posts/2018-12-31_2018-retrospective/images/1.jpeg#layoutTextWidth)
these circles represent 2018

First, a disclaimer. I’m incredibly privileged to be able to write a piece like this. By and large, 2018 was a terrific year for me. The toughest hardship I faced was when I was mugged and had to buy a new iPhone. Or maybe it was when a not-so-nice landlord tried to gyp our security deposit. The point is, many [people in America](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cable-tech-dick-cheney-sex-dungeon_us_5c0ea571e4b06484c9fd4c21) and [around the world](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/30/world/middleeast/gaza-medic-israel-shooting.html) are [struggling](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/12/what-its-like-to-deliver-packages-for-amazon/578986/). (By the way, you should definitely read all three of those longform stories.) This post is purely an analysis of the personal development goals I had set for myself.At the beginning of the year, I set some goals for myself in 4 “buckets”: fitness, work, social, and fun. So how did I do? Here’s my self-assessment:

*   [Fitness] Get better at climbing. **7/10**
*   [Fitness] Run 2 half marathons at a sub 8:00/mi pace. Stretch goal of 365 miles this year. **4/10**
*   [Work] _Redacted_
*   [Social] Meet 1 new person per week. **6/10**
*   [Social] Start dating. **1/10**
*   [Fun] Get better at video. **6/10**
*   [Fun] Travel as much as I did in 2017. **9/10**

Overall, the exercise and fun buckets are doing well, while the social bucket needs some improvement. Let’s look at some of these in detail.

### Fitness

#### Climbing skills improved

hand-sketched graphs: artisanal data science

At the beginning of the year, I was at around the V0-V1 bouldering level. Now I can do pretty much any V2 and about half of the V3s. Also, I learned how to top rope! Unfortunately, frequency of visiting Dogpatch/Mission Cliffs tapered off in the second half of the year: [22x in Q1, 19x in Q2, 13x in Q3, 5x in Q4](http://life.daylen.com/zero/sport/), which can be explained by a longer commute that started in Q4.

#### Only one half marathon

strava thinks I ran an extra 0.3 miles



Originally I was slated to run both the SF Half and the Berkeley Half, but the Berkeley Half was cancelled due to the cancerous Camp Fire air. (Sad!) My [pace for the SF Half was 8:05](https://www.strava.com/activities/1735879240), just short of my 8:00 goal pace. I felt pretty good throughout the race, so I likely could have gone a bit faster. Total mileage run this year was only 110 miles, which is less than ⅓ of a 365 mile stretch goal. I expect to smash my goal pace next year.

#### A resurgence in cycling

Not a goal I defined at the beginning of the year, but I started cycling more this year after a lull in 2017. This is mostly due to meeting Emily Cheng, an absolute badass, who dragged me on early morning Fat Cake Club rides and weekend excursions, including my [first ever century ride](https://www.strava.com/activities/1973002755)! I recently started bringing my X-T2 on rides and got some sick photos.

### Social

#### Friendships

In retrospect, “meet 1 new person per week” is kind of arbitrary goal since quantity isn’t more important than quality. Instead, a better goal to strive for is to _maintain and strengthen existing friendships while selectively adding meaningful ones_. To that end, in June I adopted what I call The Spreadsheet Method, which allows me to keep track of meaningful interactions with people.
![image](/posts/2018-12-31_2018-retrospective/images/5.png#layoutTextWidth)
like a CRM, but for friends

Here’s how it works: on sheet 2, you write down a name, date, and description whenever you have a meaningful interaction that you want to remember. Sheet 1 has a row for each person, and using ~*formulas*~ it looks at sheet 2 to find the most recent meaningful interaction. And with conditional formatting, you can see at a glance who you should sync up with next (red = haven’t seen them in forever).

You could also add a ranking column so that you can prioritize who to hang out with. To be clear, this is not an absolute scoring of each person—it’s a relative ranking based on desired interaction frequency.

With all that said, we can see that among friends with an above-median F-rank, there’s a healthy mix of new (met within the last two years) and old friends, and the last meaningful interaction column doesn’t have a ton of red. I’d call that a success!

Is it reductive to quantify friendships this way? Sure. For me, it’s improved my ability to keep up with people. If you want to try it out, I [made a template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eWoOGeg1rUYCDOYXGFG0JG2hMbip17Z5JfilVYrQ9mE) that you can dupe.

#### Dating

I didn’t make much progress on this one this year. Something to address in 2019!

### Fun

#### Daylen Yang Productions?

My favorite channels on YouTube include [Mango Street](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5bp5_6h-ZxkBz6S_33ZUVg), [Casey Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtinbF-Q-fVthA0qrFQTgXQ), and [kold](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_tXKhJlqZrgr_qdhEKmrDQ). These channels excel at lifestyle vlogging/the travel genre, and I wanted to get better at making those types of videos.

It’s sort of cheating since I filmed all of the shots in 2017, but I put together _A Taste of California_ in April:



It’s alright, featuring gratuitous drone footage and decent cutting to the music. (I’m especially proud of the fast bits.) But there’s no color grading, and no narrative either.

I fixed the lack of color grading in my [Death Valley recap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZoJ62ASB6Q). But still, no story, and that’s a much more difficult problem to fix. When I look at Mango Street videos, every shot seems to have a purpose, and they all fit together to tell a story. That’s something I need to work on in 2019.

#### Globetrotting

As some of you might know, I religiously check in on Foursquare’s Swarm app everywhere I go. Which makes it perfect for answering the question: how much did I travel this year? A good amount:

*   International destinations this year included Banff (Canada), Hong Kong, and Singapore.
*   Within the U.S., I hopped over to Salt Lake City, New Mexico, and New York.
*   Within California, I road tripped to Joshua Tree, Death Valley, Los Angeles, Lake Tahoe, and more.

#### Usefulness of goals in the Fun bucket

As the self-proclaimed King of Fun™, I don’t really need goals in this bucket as I kind of gravitate towards doing these things automatically. I likely won’t set any goals in this bucket for next year.

### Miscellaneous 2018 facts

*   Number of photos taken on my camera: 8,889 (down from 13,379 in 2017)
*   Cocktail bars visited: 12 (up from ~0 in 2017)
*   Steps taken: 2.1 million (down from 3.7M in 2017)
*   Times I visited Ritual Coffee Roasters: 17 (up from ~0 in 2017)
*   Distinct airports visited: 10 (down from 20 in 2017)
*   Number of meaningful interactions logged: 543 (untracked in 2017)
*   Miles cycled: 711 miles (up from 249 in 2017)### 2019

There’s so much I want to get done in 2019. I’m still finalizing the list, but here’s my current thinking:

*   [Fitness] Do a triathlon
*   [Fitness] While we’re at it, get a six pack
*   [Mind] Read more books (metric needed)
*   [Mind] Write more essays (metric needed)
*   [Mind] Listen to more podcasts (metric needed)
*   [Social] Dating
