iPhone X preorders are right around the corner (October 27 @ 12:01 AM) and if you’re a privileged AF tech worker with 1K to burn, you have that date saved in your [$50 todo list app](https://culturedcode.com/things/) and you’re gonna do it, because why not?

Same.

### Screen Size

There is only one screen size, you dolt.

### Carrier

Probably whatever carrier you currently have.

### Color

You _obviously_ need to get it in white, because that color provides the most contrast with the new vertical dual camera configuration, which means that more people will know that you have the iPhone X, and therefore are a privileged AF tech worker with 1K to burn. See paragraph 1.

### Storage Capacity

256, duh.

And there you have it! Now you know exactly which iPhone X to buy. Have some bonus content:
